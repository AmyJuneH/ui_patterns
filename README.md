# UI Patterns
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nuvoleweb/ui_patterns.svg?branch=8.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/nuvoleweb/ui_patterns)

Define self-contained UI patterns as Drupal plugins and use them seamlessly in your [panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels), 
[field groups](https://www.drupal.org/project/field_group) or [Display Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) view modes.

The module also generates a pattern library page to be used as documentation for content editors or as a showcase 
for business and clients:
