Welcome to UI Patterns's documentation
======================================

The UI Patterns module allows developers to define self-contained UI patterns as Drupal plugins and use them seamlessly
in their `panels <https://www.drupal.org/project/panels>`_, `field groups <https://www.drupal.org/project/field_group>`_
or `Display Suite <https://www.drupal.org/project/ds>`_  view modes.

The module also generates a pattern library page to be used as documentation for content editors or as a showcase
for business like the one shown below:
